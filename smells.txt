1. Lines 558-568 are repeated in lines 606-616.  This is a code smell and is an
example of a Change Preventer.  If the code starting at 558 is changed, the code
starting at 606 must also be changed for changes to successfully be implemented.
This can make program development more complicated and expensive.
