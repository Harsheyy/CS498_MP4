1. Lines 558-568 are repeated in lines 606-616.  This is a code smell and is an
example of a Change Preventer.  If the code starting at 558 is changed, the code
starting at 606 must also be changed for changes to successfully be implemented.
This can make program development more complicated and expensive.

3. The code smell here may very well be a case of Object-Orientation Abuse.  Since
the updateComputerList and trimLabels methods lie outside the scope of just the Nodes
class, it would make more sense to move this method to another place, such as the 
overall Jenkins class.

4. The code smell here repeats an if statement 4 times and adding an i to each iteration. You can easily replace this code smell by using a while statement or a for loop where you can have a certain number of iterations depending on the i. This would make the code more efficient and easier to follow.
